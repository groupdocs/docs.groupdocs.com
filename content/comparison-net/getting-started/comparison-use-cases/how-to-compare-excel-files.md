Let's say you have two Excel workbooks, or maybe two versions of the same workbook, that you want to compare. Or maybe you want to find potential problems, like manually-entered (instead of calculated) totals, or broken formulas. If you have Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013, you can use Microsoft Spreadsheet Compare to run a report on the differences and problems it finds.

{{< alert style="info" >}}Important:  Spreadsheet Compare is only available with Office Professional Plus 2013 or Office 365 ProPlus.{{< /alert >}}

To compare two Excel workbooks with Office Professional Plus 2013 you should:

*   Click **Home > Compare Files**. The Compare Files dialog box appears.

*   Click the green folder icon next to the **To** box to browse to the location of the workbook that you want to compare to the earlier version, and then click **OK**.
*   In the left pane, choose the options you want to see in the results of the workbook comparison by checking or unchecking the options, such as **Formulas**, **Macros**, or **Cell Format**. Or, just **Select All**.

## How to compare Excel files using GroupDocs.Comparison

Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 offers spreadsheet comparisons, but **[GroupDocs.Comparison](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/net)** provides a possibility to compare worksheet programmatically and you can compare not only two different files, but several at once. Let's say, there are three or more price list for few years (For example: "2018", "2019", "2020") in the XLSX format or other [supported file formats]({{< ref "comparison-net/getting-started/supported-document-formats.md" >}}). other and you need to compare their contents. Here is an example of how to compare three price lists using GroupDocs.Comparsion API. Usually you just have to follow these steps:

*   Instantiate [Comparer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/comparison/groupdocs.comparison/comparer) object with source document path or stream;
*   Call [Add](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/comparison/groupdocs.comparison/comparer/methods/add/index) method and specify target document path or stream. Repeat this step for every target document;
*   Call [Compare](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/comparison/groupdocs.comparison/comparer/methods/compare/index)method.

Here is the code that is used to compare three price lists.

`string` `sourceDocumentPath =` `@"Source Price List.xlsx"``;` `// NOTE: Put here actual path to source document`

`string` `targetOneDocumentPath =` `@"Target Price List 1.xlsx"``;` `// NOTE: Put here actual path to target one document`

`string` `targetTwoDocumentPath =` `@"Target Price List 2.xlsx"``;` `// NOTE: Put here actual path to target two document`

`string` `outputPath =` `@"Result Price List.xlsx"``;` `// NOTE: Put here actual path to result document`

`using` `(Comparer comparer =` `new` `Comparer(sourceDocumentPath))`

`{`

`comparer.Add(targetOneDocumentPath);`

`comparer.Add(targetTwoDocumentPath);`

`comparer.Compare(outputPath);`

`}`

As a result, we get a XSLX file where the deleted elements are marked in **red**, the added – in **blue**, and the modified – in **green**
